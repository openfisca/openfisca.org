# Release process

## Continuous deployment

All OpenFisca official packages are continuously released.

When a pull request is merged to the `master` branch, a continuous integration server automatically:

- Publishes a version tag on GitHub.
- Publishes a release on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
