# How to test your changes on "ready to use" situations (for OpenFisca-France)

Often, when making changes to legislation, you need to test it on a situation that works with your country's tax and benefit system.
Sometimes, these situations can be quite complicated to model (such as roomates).
Instead of re-writing them everytime, we have pre-packaged a few in a Python Package.

You can find the package along with a usage example in the [Tutorial repository](https://github.com/openfisca/tutorial/tree/master/python/scripts/generate_situation_examples)
