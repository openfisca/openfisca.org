### This website does not show a consent banner for cookies, why?

Out tracking tool, [Matomo](https://matomo.org), is set up in compliance with the "Cookies" recommandations from the French data privacy authority, the [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/solutions-pour-la-mesure-daudience), which allows the lack of prior consent. In particular, your IP address is anonymised before any visit is tracked.
