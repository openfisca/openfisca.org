## Working groups

Working groups structure discussions around specific lines of work on the development of OpenFisca, either targeting the product side, the community side or the Association itself. These spaces also allow members to collaborate on projects that benefit the entire OpenFisca community. As per the Association’s [statutes (§10)]({{< relref path="/association/statutes/#article-10-board-of-directors" >}}), the Board may delegate some of its powers to these working groups. Working groups are open to all Association members.

The following working groups are currently active:

- [Technical working group]({{< relref path="/association/working-groups/technical-working-group" >}})

## Members

To balance the interests of the community over time, regardless of the number of parties involved, all members are assigned to different colleges. A proportion of votes is allocated to each college for voting at the General Meeting.

### College B: Implementors

These entities use OpenFisca to provide services to end users through apps, reports, consulting… They support the product that enables these products by contributing a membership fee [based]({{< relref path="/association/rules-of-procedure" >}}) on the number of users of their services and the gross national income of their country of establishment.
