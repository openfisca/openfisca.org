### 2) Fees

#### A. College A (college of supporters)

Fee is indexed on mean daily income in country of activity. The source data is the World Bank's [SI.SPR.PC40](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.SPR.PC40) indicator, converted to current euros.

If members do not want to disclose their country of activity or do not want to calculate their contribution, they must pay an amount higher than the highest value in the SI.SPR.PC40.

#### B. College B (college of legal entities using OpenFisca)

Fee is indexed on the number of users of the tools provided by the entity and their country of establishment, rounded up to the next thousand.

For private entities, the number of users is considered to be the number of monthly visitors to the website that hosts the OpenFisca-based service, no matter how many actually use any given service.

For public entities, the number of users is considered to be the number of citizens that they administer, no matter how many actually use any given service. For national (or federal in federated states) public entities, the fee is is always 100% of the country GNI PP, rounded up to the next thousand.

| Number of users | Proportion of country GNI PP | Example: France 2023 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0 – 50 000 | 5% | 3000 € |
| 50 0000 – 100 000 | 10% | 6000 € |
| 100 000 – 500 000 | 15% | 9000 € |
| 500 000 – 1 000 000 | 25% | 15 000 € |
| 1M – 5M | 50% | 30 000 € |
| \>5M | 100% | 60 000 € |

#### C. College C (college of legal entities selling OpenFisca implementation support services)

Fees are the same as college A.

#### E. College E (college of senior contributors)

Fees are the same as college A.

### 4) Exclusion

Any member may report an entity to the Board if they identify or suspect that it undertakes actions contrary to the rules governing the use or contribution to OpenFisca, or that otherwise harm the association's purpose or operation. Such a report may be filed anonymously.

The Board will investigate the report. If it cannot invalidate the suspicions, it will summon the suspected entity to provide an explanation and potentially stop and repair the damage. If the suspicions are confirmed and the harm cannot be stopped and repaired, the Board will exclude the entity and will dispatch that information, along with its investigation report, to all members. In all cases, the Board will report its findings at the latest at the next AG.

## 3\. Executive direction

1. The Executive Director (ED) is a person hired to handle all executive actions for the Foundation on behalf of the Board. That person reports to the Board.
