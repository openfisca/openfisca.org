- demonstrate their contributions.

Contributions are confirmed by college E on a monthly basis. Any member may appeal to college E’s decision to the Board, who may then add the topic to the next general assembly if it disagrees with college E's decision. Only the AG may overturn college E's decision.

In order to even out renewals, college E members may anticipate the renewal of their statute up to two years before expiry.

### 2) Fees

#### A. College A (college of supporters)

Fee is indexed on mean daily income in country of activity. The source data is the World Bank's [SI.SPR.PC40](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.SPR.PC40) indicator, converted to current euros.

If members do not want to disclose their country of activity or do not want to calculate their contribution, they must pay an amount higher than the highest value in the SI.SPR.PC40.

#### B. College B (college of legal entities using OpenFisca)

Fee is indexed on the number of users of the tools provided by the entity and their country of establishment, rounded up to the next thousand.

For private entities, the number of users is considered to be the number of monthly visitors to the website that hosts the OpenFisca-based service, no matter how many actually use any given service.

For public entities, the number of users is considered to be the number of citizens that they administer, no matter how many actually use any given service. For national (or federal in federated states) public entities, the fee is is always 100% of the country GNI PP, rounded up to the next thousand.

| Number of users | Proportion of country GNI PP | Example: France 2023 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0 – 50 000 | 5% | 3000 € |
| 50 0000 – 100 000 | 10% | 6000 € |
| 100 000 – 500 000 | 15% | 9000 € |
| 500 000 – 1 000 000 | 25% | 15 000 € |
| 1M – 5M | 50% | 30 000 € |
| \>5M | 100% | 60 000 € |

For non-profit non-governmental organisations, a 90% discount applies.

#### C. College C (college of legal entities selling OpenFisca implementation support services)

##### a. Minimum yearly fee

A minimum yearly fee applies, based on the number of collaborators (employees and contractors) working in the entity.

| Number of collaborators | Minimum fee |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 300 € |
| 2 – 5 | 500 € |
| 6 – 10 | 1 000 € |
| 11 – 20 | 2 000 € |
| 21 – 50 | 5 000 € |
| 51 – 100 | 10 000 € |
| 101 – 999 | 30 000 € |
| \> 1 000 | 50 000 € |

##### b. Contract-based fee

The full fee is a flat 3% of every revenue (service, consulting…) that can be attributed to OpenFisca.

For the avoidance of doubt: if the flat fee is above the minimum fee, only the flat fee is paid. The flat fee does not come on top of the minimum fee.

##### c. Exemption for services paid for by the Association

To prevent [kickbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(finance)), revenue that is coming from contracts with the Association is exempt.

#### D. College D (college of individuals who have contributed recently)

Fees are the same as college A.

#### E. College E (college of senior contributors)

Fees are the same as college A.

### 3) Payment

All fees are paid transparently on AssoConnect.

### 4) Exclusion

Any member may report an entity to the Board if they identify or suspect that it undertakes actions contrary to the rules governing the use or contribution to OpenFisca, or that otherwise harm the association's purpose or operation. Such a report may be filed anonymously.

The Board will investigate the report. If it cannot invalidate the suspicions, it will summon the suspected entity to provide an explanation and potentially stop and repair the damage. If the suspicions are confirmed and the harm cannot be stopped and repaired, the Board will exclude the entity and will dispatch that information, along with its investigation report, to all members. In all cases, the Board will report its findings at the latest at the next AG.

## 3\. Executive direction

1. The Executive Director (ED) is a person hired to handle all executive actions for the Foundation on behalf of the Board. That person reports to the Board.
2. All applications are presented at the AG. The ED is chosen by the Board. They are mandated for a period of 1 year.
3. The ED can be suspended and summoned to explain themselves in case the Board suspects actions that go against their mandate. In case the explanations are not satisfactory, the ED can be repealed by the Board with a 30 days notice period.

## 4\. Committees

1. The Board may create committees and delegate some of its duties to them.
2. Committees are announced to all members.
3. All members are free to join and leave any committee.

## 5\. General assemblies

1. Ordinary general assemblies take place each year on the first week of February.
2. Invitations to ordinary general assemblies are sent each year in January, at least 15 days before the chosen date.
3. Invitations are sent only over email.

## 6\. Access to secrets

All secrets (passwords, access keys…) that grant access to administrative actions are stored in a shared database. Access to the database is provided to the Board members and is updated whenever the Board changes. The Board members may provide access to secrets to other entities to enable them to fulfill the duties they get delegated.
