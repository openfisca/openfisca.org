## Day 1: Policy innovation for better public outcomes

Policy making and delivery has largely not kept pace with the increased speed, complexity and pressures of change and changing expectations in a modern, polycrisis world. Civil services around the world have hungrily adopted new methods and technologies, but what is working to drive measurable, scalable and sustainable public good? How might policy as a discipline evolve and transform to become more adaptive, humane and impactful? What can we learn from the past, and might a better future look like that we can work towards?

The Policy Innovation for Public Good event is dedicated to exploring these questions, through international and cross-disciplinary cooperation, bringing together a wide range of civil servants and policy aficionados to share experience, aspirations and bring bold collective reimagining of policy making and delivery.

## Day 2: Rules as Code around the world with OpenFisca

The second International OpenFisca Conference will bring together policymakers and technical experts to advance transparency, innovation, and collaboration in Rules as Code. The intention of this event is to explore and share Rules as Code case studies, best practices and innovative approaches, and celebrate public and civil society actors who have made strong achievements. OpenFisca is the world’s most widely adopted free and open-source platform to write, provide and support proactive modelling and operational use of Rules as Code. This annual conference provides both a chance to learn from exciting Rules as Code innovation around the world, and to extend our collective vision towards where we need to go.
