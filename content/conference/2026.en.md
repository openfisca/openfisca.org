## Day 1: Policy innovation for better public outcomes

Policy making and delivery has largely not kept pace with the increased speed, complexity and pressures of change and changing expectations in a modern, polycrisis world. Civil services around the world have hungrily adopted new methods and technologies, but what is working to drive measurable, scalable and sustainable public good? How might policy as a discipline evolve and transform to become more adaptive, humane and impactful? What can we learn from the past, and might a better future look like that we can work towards?

The Policy Innovation for Public Good event is dedicated to exploring these questions, through international and cross-disciplinary cooperation, bringing together a wide range of civil servants and policy aficionados to share experience, aspirations and bring bold collective reimagining of policy making and delivery.
