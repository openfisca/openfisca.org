## Yearly conference

The OpenFisca Association organises a yearly conference dedicated to OpenFisca usages and adoption around the world, federating its community, demonstrating the achievements of its members, and promoting global adoption and collaboration, in line with its [mission statement]({{< relref path="/association/" >}}).

In order to give representation to the diverse user and contributor base of OpenFisca, the Association aims at organising the conference in a different continent each year.

To maximise value for international participants and increase discoverability, the Association aims at co-organising another local event with a broader focus alongside its yearly conference.
