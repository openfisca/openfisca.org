Community As contributors to a common, we collectively do our best to make our community a space where everyone can express themselves and feel free to be who they are. Our rules to that end are grown progressively as we learn what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>Available packages</title><link>https://openfisca.org/en/packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openfisca.org/en/packages/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Legal notice</title><link>https://openfisca.org/en/legal-notice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openfisca.org/en/legal-notice/</guid><description>Editor OpenFisca Association (association under French law loi 1901)

Created in 2011 with support from the French government1, OpenFisca has been adopted by a growing number of public and research actors, and subsequently by the private sector. OpenFisca has been progressively deployed in a growing number of regions around the world, and now covers every continent. It is the collaboration of a diverse ecosystem on a single technical object that has enabled this tool to make the innovations promised by the &amp;ldquo;Rules as Code&amp;rdquo; approach a reality.</description></item><item><title>Styleguide</title><link>https://openfisca.org/en/styleguide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openfisca.org/en/styleguide/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
